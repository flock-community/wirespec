# Generate code

The vision of code generation centers on enabling a contract-first approach where specifications act as the single source of truth. By prioritizing the specification over the implementation, development is streamlined, reducing ambiguity and fostering better collaboration among cross-functional teams.

Interfaces, often mapped to the domain, play a pivotal role in this vision. They are designed to have a longer lifespan compared to implementation code and must remain isolated to ensure they are reusable, adaptable, and independent of specific technological constraints. This isolation allows interfaces to act as durable blueprints, transcending implementation changes and maintaining a stable foundation for the system's evolution.

Code generation helps bridge the gap between specification and implementation by automating the creation of typesafe, functional, and dependency-free code from the specification. This approach ensures that the generated code precisely reflects the defined interfaces, capturing all possible inputs, outputs, and interactions in a consistent and predictable manner.
