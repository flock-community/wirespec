A channel is a model for message passing. A message may be sent over a channel, where another process or thread with a
reference to said channel, is able to receive it. Examples include remote procedure calls, or message brokers.

Channels can be defined using the `channel` keyword, along with an identifier and [type](types).

```wirespec
channel NotificationQueue -> Task
```

## Annotations on Channels

Channels can be annotated to provide metadata for message handling, routing, or other channel-specific behavior:

```wirespec
@QueueType("persistent")
@MaxRetries("3")
channel NotificationQueue -> Task

@Topic("user.events")
@PartitionKey("userId")
channel UserEventStream -> UserEvent
```
