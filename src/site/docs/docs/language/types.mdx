In Wirespec, everything that gets sent over the wire is a type.

## Primitive

This section describes the primitive types used in Wirespec:
 - `String`
 - `Boolean`
 - `Integer`
 - `Number` (For Real numbers, so i.e. float/double)
 - `Number32`
 - `Bytes`
 - `Unit` (Only used to indicate the absence of a response body)

## Composite

A composite type in wirespec allows you to group together fields of different types under a single named structure.
Think of it as creating your own custom data structure or record. It's the foundation for building complex data
representations and is what you would typically use to define your Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or similar data
structures.

```wirespec
type User {
    id: Integer,
    name: String,
}
```

It is also possible to reference other types that you defined:

```wirespec
type Person {
    name: String,
    address: Address
}

type Address {
    streetName: String,
    houseNumber: Integer
}
```

The same applies to other types, such as [refined](#refined):

```wirespec
type Person {
  firstname: Name,
  lastName: Name
}

type Name /^[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,50}$/g
```

Additionally, fields can be defined as optional using a `?`, or as a list using `[]`:

```wirespec
type Product {
    name: String,
    description: String?,
    tags: String[]
}
```

## Enum

Enums (enumerations) in Wirespec are used to define a type that can only take on one of a predefined set of named
values. Enums are ideal for situations where a field can only have a fixed number of possibilities:

```wirespec
enum Direction {
    NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST
}
```

Both upper case and camel case values are accepted:

```wirespec
enum Role {
    SoftwareEngineer,
    SystemAdmin
}
```

## Refined

Using simple string values as types is often too lenient. You might need to enforce specific patterns, ranges, or
formats for your data. Refined types allow you to be more specific, constrained types based on existing ones, ensuring
data conforms to certain rules. A common use case for refined types is to use a regular expression to define allowed
patterns for strings. You can define a refined type as follows:

```wirespec
type Date /^([0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}-20[0-9]{2})$/g
```

## Union

In Wirespec, a union type represents a value that can be one of several different types. The key characteristic is that
at any given time, the value holds only one of those types. It can be defined using `type` keyword and consists of a
list of non-primitive types separated by a `|` (union operator):

```wirespec
type Result = Win | Loss

type Win {
    points: Integer,
    nextOpponent: User
}

type Loss {
   points: Integer,
}
```
