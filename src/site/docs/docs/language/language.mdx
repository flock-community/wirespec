# Wirespec Language

## Definitions

Definitions are the core building blocks of Wirespec. This is a collection of basic syntax elements and examples
necessary for creating these definitions:
 - [Endpoint](language/endpoints)
 - [Channel](language/channels)
 - [Type](language/types)


A Wirespec file consists of a set of definitions in any order.
