## Definitions

Definitions are the core building blocks of Wirespec. This is a collection of basic syntax elements and examples
necessary for creating these definitions:

- [Endpoint](language/endpoints)
- [Channel](language/channels)
- [Type](language/types)

A Wirespec file consists of a set of definitions in any order.

## Comments

Just like most modern languages, Wirespec supports single-line (or **end-of-line**) and multi-line (**block**) comments. Comments can only be placed above definitions and are used to document them:

```wirespec
// This is an end-of-line comment
endpoint GetTodos GET /todos -> {
    200 -> Todo[]
}

/* This is a block comment
 * on multiple lines
 */
type Todo {
    id: Integer,
    title: String,
    completed: Boolean
}
```

Comments placed above definitions are also used to emit comments in the target languages when code is generated, though this behavior may vary depending on the target language and emitter implementation.

## Annotations

Annotations provide a way to attach metadata to definitions in Wirespec. They are denoted by the `@` symbol followed by an identifier and can optionally include parameters. Annotations can be applied to endpoints, channels, types, and enums to provide additional information for code generation or processing:

```wirespec
@Deprecated("No longer used in V2")
type User {
    id: Integer,
    name: String
}

@Deprecated("Use GetUserV2 instead")
endpoint GetUser GET /users/{id: Integer} -> {
    200 -> User
}
```

Annotations can also have named attributes with different value types:

```wirespec
@Security(role: "admin", level: 1)
@RateLimit(requests: 100, period: "hour")
endpoint AdminEndpoint GET /admin -> {
    200 -> AdminData
}

@Validate(min: 1, max: 100, required: true)
type Score {
    value: Integer
}
```

Multiple annotations can be applied to the same definition:

```wirespec
@JsonSerializable("strict")
@ValidateInput
type CreateUserRequest {
    name: String,
    email: String
}
```

## Coding Conventions

Commonly known and easy-to-follow coding conventions are vital for any language. Here we provide guidelines on the code
style and code organization for projects that use Wirespec.

### Source file names

A wirespec file can have any name as long as it a `.ws` extension. However, it is a good idea to name a Wirespec
file after the resource it describes, in [kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case). Generated
output gets written to a file in the target language with a matching name (if allowed).

### Identifiers

All definitions in Wirespec have an identifier that is used to either reference types in other places, or in case of
channels and endpoints, for code generation. Identifiers should be named in
[upper camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case).

### Indentation

Use four spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.

For curly braces, put the opening brace at the end of the line where the construct begins, and the closing brace on a
separate line aligned horizontally with the opening construct.

```wirespec
endpoint GetTodos GET /todos -> {
    200 -> Todo[]
}
```
