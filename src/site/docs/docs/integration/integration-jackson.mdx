If you're using Jackson for serialization/deserialization you can make use of the Wirespec Jackson plugin to ensure
proper behaviour in all cases. Though not strictly required in all scenarios we recommend that you always use the
jackson integration to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Setup

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">
        ```xml title="pom.xml"
        <dependency>
            <groupId>community.flock.wirespec.integration</groupId>
            <artifactId>jackson</artifactId>
            <version>0.14.3</version>
        </dependency>
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">
        ```gradle title="build.gradle.kts"
        implementation("community.flock.wirespec.integration:jackson:0.14.3")
        ```
    </TabItem>

:::note
The following sections go into detail about the problems that we must circumvent when using Jackson in combination with
Wirespec. As a user of Wirespec there is **no** need to fully understand such intricacies, so feel free to skip ahead.

## Refined and Enum types

For each type we define in Wirespec we want to have a class in the target language representing it. To illustrate the
problems that arise when working with Jackson let's observe the following Wirespec definition:

```wirespec
type Name /^[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,50}$/g

type Person {
  firstname: Name,
  lastName: Name
}
```

This will give us, among others, the following record for the Name type:

```java
public record Name(String value) implements Wirespec.Refined {
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return value;
    }

    public static boolean validate(Name record) {
        return java.util.regex.Pattern.compile("^[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,50}$").matcher(record.value).find();
    }

    @Override
    public String getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

This is great in terms of type-safety, however, Jackson would serialize to the following JSON:

```json
{
    "firstName":{
      "value": "Foo"
    },
    "lastName":{
      "value": "Bar"
    }
}
```

And, we do not want our implementation to factor in the specific serializer/deserializer being used. The Jackson
integration package solves this problem by flat-mapping this case for us to what we would expect based on the
definition:

```json
{
    "firstName": "Foo",
    "lastName": "Bar"
}
```

## Language keywords

Wirespec can sometimes conflict with the language specifics of the target language. For example, it is not possible to
declare a variable in Java named `final`, but we may still want to have such a contract:

```wirespec
type Document {
    content: String,
    // highlight-next-line
    final: Boolean // A keyword in Java
}
```

In this case, the contract will remain unchanged, but for serialization and deserialization we will prefix this variable
with an `_`:

```java
public record Document(
    String content,
    // highlight-next-line
    Boolean _final
) {}
```
