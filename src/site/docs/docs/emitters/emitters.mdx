# Emitters

Wirespec provides two types of emitters:

1. Emitters that generate functional source code (`Java`, `Kotlin`, `TypeScript`).
2. Emitters that transform Wirespec into another specification format (`OpenAPI`, `Avro`).

## Structure

This diagram outlines the generic structure of the code generated by Wirespec. The structure is designed to be consistent across all supported languages, with minor adaptations to take advantage of language-specific features where appropriate.

The structure consists of two main parts:

- **Shared Part:** Contains the interfaces that represent the Wirespec functional model.
- **Specific Part:** Contains the models for all types, endpoints, and channels.

## Examples
In the specific documentation of the language examples the following Wirespec is used as input:

These links provide additional details about the emitted code structure and implementation specifics for each supported programming language.
