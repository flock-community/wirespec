# Project Name

This is the documentation source of wirespec, on [wirespec.io](https://wirespec.io) (COMING SOON)

The website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Maintaining / updating the documentation

As the `docs` are part of the wirespec monorepo, they will automatically be build when building the whole project ([see root readme](../../../README.md)).

To run docusaurus locally:

1. Navigate to the docs folder 
    ```bash
   cd src/site/docs
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
3. Run docusaurus
    ```bash
   npm start
    ```
