# Wirespec

_Readable contracts and typesafe wires made easy_

## Introduction


Wirespec is a modern tool that enhances software development by streamlining the process of designing, documenting, and implementing APIs.
While the software industry offers numerous solutions for designing contracts between services, Wirespec distinguishes itself by using a simple language model and multi-language compatibility.

Here are some key reasons why you might want to use Wirespec:

1. Simplified API Design through Human-Readable contracts
    * Wirespec provides a clear, structured approach to defining APIs, making it easier to design endpoints, data models, and interactions.
    * By focusing on a consistent specification, it reduces ambiguity in communication between teams.

2. Reduced Development Time
    * With its automated tools and predefined workflows, Wirespec allows developers to focus on business logic rather than repetitive tasks.
    * By catching issues early in the design phase, it reduces costly revisions during later stages of development.
    * By offering platform-native tools, it enables a seamless development experience.

3. Future-Proof Development
    * As software systems grow more complex, having a robust, standardized approach to API development ensures scalability and maintainability.
    * Wirespec facilitates the generation of the required code to enable secure and consistent data transfer across various programming languages. This eliminates the need for extensive API specifications defined as JSON schemas, and minimizes unnecessary back-and-forth between teams, and simplify communication across microservices.
    * Since code generated by Wirespec has no dependencies on other libraries or frameworks, it ensures maximum stability and reliability.

In summary, using Wirespec during software development leads to faster, more reliable, and collaborative API creation while reducing errors and improving overall project efficiency.
## Wirespec playground

You can explore and experiment with Wirespec by using the [Wirespec playground](https://playground.wirespec.io). Whether you are new to Wirespec or a seasoned user, the playground makes is simple to design, test and improve your API specifications- all in one place.

Wirespec can read and convert OpenApiSpecification (OAS) files.


## Syntax

Wirespec knows four definitions: `refined`, `enum`, `type`, `endpoint`.

### Refined

```wirespec
type DEFINITION /REGEX/g
```

### Enum

```wirespec
enum DEFINITION {
    ENTRY, ENTRY, ...
}
```

### Type

```wirespec
type DEFINITION {
    IDENTIFIER: REFERENCE
}
```

### Union

```wirespec
type DEFINITION = ENTRY | ENTRY | ...
```

### Endpoint

```wirespec
endpoint DEFINITION METHOD [INPUT_REFERENCE] PATH [? QUERY] [# HEADER] -> {
    STATUS -> REFERENCE
}
```

## Example

`todo.ws`

```wirespec
type UUID /^[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\b-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\b-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\b-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\b-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}$/g

type Todo {
    id: UUID,
    name: String,
    done: Boolean
}

type TodoInput {
    name: String,
    done: Boolean
}

type Error {
    code: String,
    description: String
}

endpoint GetTodoById GET /todos/{ id: UUID } -> {
    200 -> Todo[]
    404 -> Error
}

endpoint GetTodos GET /todos?{ done: Boolean? }#{ limit: Integer, offset: Integer } -> {    
    200 -> Todo[]
    404 -> Error
}

endpoint CreateTodo POST TodoInput /todos -> {
    200 -> Todo
    404 -> Error
}

endpoint UpdateTodo PUT TodoInput /todos/{id:UUID} -> {
    200 -> Todo
    404 -> Error
}

endpoint DeleteTodo DELETE /todos/{id:UUID} -> {
    200 -> Todo
    404 -> Error
}
```
